## Steps

First, clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/j-faria/kima-them-all.git
cd kima-them-all
```

Then, checkout a new branch from master (change "mybranch" to whatever you want):

```
git checkout -b mybranch --track origin/master
```

Create a new directory for the **kima** analysis.
You can do this with the `kima-template` if you have _pykima_ installed

```
kima-template RunThisDirectory
```

or by hand

```
mkdir RunThisDirectory

```
